### Thanks for stopping by!

I'm currently studying Data Science at [Bloomtech](https://www.bloomtech.com/courses/data-science) and open to new opportunities in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

I work with the standard Python ML stack - Pandas, scikit-learn, etc. I'm also familar with Large Language Models like GPT.

I previously worked in Material Science Research & Development after receiving my degree in Chemical Engineering. My first [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10433700B2/) was granted in 2019.

I'll be sharing some projects soon! In the meantime, connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregsamek/)
