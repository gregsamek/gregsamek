### Thanks for stopping by!

Check out my project [TinyNews](https://gregsamek.github.io/TinyNews/) - I generated ~90 million tokens of synthetic text data and used it to train several small GPT-2 style models form scratch.

I recently completed the Data Science program at [Bloomtech](https://www.bloomtech.com/). I previously worked in material science research & development after receiving my degree in chemical engineering. My first [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10433700B2/) was granted in 2019.
