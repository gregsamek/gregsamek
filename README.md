### Thanks for stopping by!

I'm an engineer and artificial intelligence researcher. I have a particular interest in LLMs. Check out my project [TinyNews](https://gregsamek.github.io/TinyNews/), which involved generating synthetic text data and using it to train several small GPT-2 style models form scratch.

I recently completed the Data Science program at [Bloomtech](https://www.bloomtech.com/courses/data-science). I previously worked in material science research & development after receiving my degree in chemical engineering. My first [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10433700B2/) was granted in 2019.
